## Lambda Profiling Beta

Datadog's [Continuous Profiler](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/code-profiling/) is now available in beta for Python in version 4.62.0 and layer version 62 and above. This optional feature is enabled by setting the `DD_PROFILING_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`. During the beta period, profiling is available at no additional cost.

The Continuous Profiler works by spawning a thread which periodically wakes up and takes a snapshot of the CPU and Heap of all running python code. This can include the profiler itself. If you want the Profiler to ignore itself, set `DD_PROFILING_IGNORE_PROFILER` to `true`.

## Major Version Notes

### 4.x / Layer version 61+

- Python3.6 support has been [deprecated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) by AWS, and support removed from this library.
- `dd-trace` upgraded from 0.61 to 1.4, full release notes are available [here](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release_notes.html#v1-0-0)
  - `get_correlation_ids()` has been changed to `get_log_correlation_context()`, which now returns a dictionary containing the active `span_id`, `trace_id`, as well as `service` and `env`.
