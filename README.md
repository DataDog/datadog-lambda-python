Datadog Lambda Library for Python (2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9) enables enhanced Lambda metrics, distributed tracing, and custom metric submission from AWS Lambda functions.  

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** AWS Lambda is expected to receive a [breaking change](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/upcoming-changes-to-the-python-sdk-in-aws-lambda/) on **December 1, 2021**. If you are using Datadog Python Lambda layer version 7 or below, please upgrade to the latest.

## Installation

Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/installation/python/), and view your function's enhanced metrics, traces and logs in Datadog.

## Custom Metrics

Once [installed](#installation), you should be able to submit custom metrics from your Lambda function.

Check out the instructions for [submitting custom metrics from AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_lambda/?tab=python#custom-metrics).

## Tracing

Once [installed](#installation), you should be able to view your function's traces in Datadog, and your function's logs should be automatically connected to the traces.

For additional details on trace collection, take a look at [collecting traces from AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_lambda/?tab=python#trace-collection). 

For additional details on trace and log connection, see [connecting logs and traces](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/connect_logs_and_traces/python/).

For additional details on the tracer, check out the [official documentation for Datadog trace client](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/index.html).

## Enhanced Metrics

Once [installed](#installation), you should be able to view enhanced metrics for your Lambda function in Datadog.

Check out the official documentation on [Datadog Lambda enhanced metrics](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_lambda/?tab=python#real-time-enhanced-lambda-metrics).

## Environment Variables

### DD_FLUSH_TO_LOG

Set to `true` (recommended) to send custom metrics asynchronously (with no added latency to your Lambda function executions) through CloudWatch Logs with the help of [Datadog Forwarder](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-serverless-functions/tree/main/aws/logs_monitoring). Defaults to `false`. If set to `false`, you also need to set `DD_API_KEY` and `DD_SITE`.

### DD_API_KEY

If `DD_FLUSH_TO_LOG` is set to `false` (not recommended), the Datadog API Key must be defined by setting one of the following environment variables:

- DD_API_KEY - the Datadog API Key in plain-text, NOT recommended
- DD_KMS_API_KEY - the KMS-encrypted API Key, requires the `kms:Decrypt` permission
- DD_API_KEY_SECRET_ARN - the Secret ARN to fetch API Key from the Secrets Manager, requires the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission (and `kms:Decrypt` if using a customer managed CMK)
- DD_API_KEY_SSM_NAME - the Parameter Name to fetch API Key from the Systems Manager Parameter Store, requires the `ssm:GetParameter` permission (and `kms:Decrypt` if using a SecureString with a customer managed CMK)

You can also supply or override the API key at runtime (not recommended):

```python
# Override DD API Key after importing datadog_lambda packages
from datadog import api
api._api_key = "MY_API_KEY"
```

### DD_SITE

If `DD_FLUSH_TO_LOG` is set to `false` (not recommended), you must set `DD_SITE`. Possible values are `datadoghq.com`, `datadoghq.eu`, `us3.datadoghq.com` and `ddog-gov.com`. The default is `datadoghq.com`.

### DD_LOGS_INJECTION

Inject Datadog trace id into logs for [correlation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/connect_logs_and_traces/python/) if you are using a `logging.Formatter` in the default `LambdaLoggerHandler` by the Lambda runtime. Defaults to `true`.

### DD_LOG_LEVEL

Set to `debug` enable debug logs from the Datadog Lambda Library. Defaults to `info`.

### DD_ENHANCED_METRICS

Generate enhanced Datadog Lambda integration metrics, such as, `aws.lambda.enhanced.invocations` and `aws.lambda.enhanced.errors`. Defaults to `true`.

### DD_LAMBDA_HANDLER

Your original Lambda handler.

### DD_TRACE_ENABLED

Initialize the Datadog tracer when set to `true`. Defaults to `false`.

### DD_MERGE_XRAY_TRACES

Set to `true` to merge the X-Ray trace and the Datadog trace, when using both the X-Ray and Datadog tracing. Defaults to `false`.
